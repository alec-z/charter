**Transparency Foundation Charter**

Fundación para la Transparencia del Software

Madrid, October 1st, 2021

“The vision of the Software Transparency Foundation is a frictionless exchange of validated and

related Software Bills of Materials (SBOM) throughout the software supply chain”

**Mission**

Our mission is to “bring transparency to the software supply-chain” with a goal of harmonizing

how information is shared about the software that we build, acquire, and operate.

Our focus will be on operationalizing existing and emerging standards like SPDX and ISO/IEC

5230 using open source tooling and data, and technologies to facilitate generating, notarizing,

relating and validating Software Bills of Materials (SBOM).

Driving adoption of SBOM

By providing Open Source tools for generating, notarizing, relating and validating Software Bills

of Materials (SBOM), we will facilitate broad adoption. This will ease Software Supply Chain

traceability, drastically reducing open source-related cybersecurity and license compliance

effort.

The Software Transparency Foundation will provide a complete set of open source Software

Composition Analysis (SCA) and other tools, which otherwise are out of reach for small and

mid-sized organizations.

Enabling a decentralized validating entity

The Software Transparency Foundation proposes to enable a decentralized SBOM Ledger to

allow public validation of SBOMs by comparing their cryptographic checksums published in a

blockchain, along with their date stamps and relationships to preceding SBOMs.

A decentralized, immutable SBOM Ledger will contribute to completeness of visibility in the

supply chain.

Facilitating SBOM interoperability

The Software Transparency Foundation aims at solving the traceability issue of software

components across the supply chain tree, without any depth limitation.

It proposes, amongst others, a decentralized SBOM ledger that will offer a format-agnostic

registry of Software Bills of Materials and their relation to their parents. This allows easily

tracing and validating software components across the supply chain, regardless of the format

in which the SBOM document is generated.

**Membership & Sponsorship Programs**

The Software Transparency Foundation offers ﬁve sponsorship programs: Diamond, Gold,

Silver, Bronze and Community

Diamond and Gold sponsors are members of the Governing Board .

In exceptional cases, the Governing Board will consider offers of relevant intellectual property,

labor, and other resources as ‘payment in kind’ towards an annual sponsorship.

All sponsors are entitled to participate in project meetings, and to identify their

company/community as sponsors of the Software Transparency Foundation.

The Community Member category of membership is limited to non-proﬁts, open source

projects and individuals, and requires approval by the Governing Board, or, if the Governing

Board sets criteria for joining as an Community member, the meeting of such criteria.

Non-Community sponsors have access to the SBOM Ledger application with a number of

prepaid transactions deﬁned for every type of Sponsorship Program.

The Governing Board shall amend/adopt the Sponsorship Program and publish it on the
